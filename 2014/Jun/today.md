#Today, ops is beautiful
I've always loved the interplay between hardware and software. And I've finally figured out why. 

Software alone is a walled garden. It's designed to just work. It's designed so that you can take my code and run it on your servers. Software is beautiful. The way all the pieces of the code come together and finally make something that you can see. All the disjoined objects and factories. Everything working together in unison. 

But software is not designed to be organic. Software is designed to not change*. It's designed to be what it is. 

Likewise hardware is designed to be static. It's designed 

But with the cloud. Oh boy! All bets are off.

With the cloud, hardware and software can play together in a way we never could. Imagine the code saying "shit, I need another server" and then GROWING ANOTHER SERVER WITHIN YOUR INFRASTRUCTURE. I want my little farm of servers to add new servers when necessary, and kill ones that aren't. I want them to know when a new server is available and when one isn't. I want it to be aware of itself in the way that we are aware of our own bodies.

I have visions of one day building the right infrastructure that can recover from downtime on its own. That has it's own scheduling built in that you will need to work around for releases. That will take care of itself! 

I want to build my replacement. I want to carefully craft it so that it can take care of itself, and just needs me to occasionally poke a few bits around to handle any [systemic anomalies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architect_(The_Matrix)) that might arise. 

*Some people might point out Evolutionary Computation to dispute this fact. Go away, you know exactly what I'm trying to say -.-*
