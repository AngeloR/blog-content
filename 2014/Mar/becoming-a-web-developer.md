# Becoming a web developer
The web is a big deal. Like, a HUGE deal. And the people that make the web have been thrown from their basements into the limelight. They've been lauded and applauded for being on the forefront of the technological innovation. But everything has its cost. Jonathon Hill posted today about the [cost of being a web developer](http://jonathonhill.net/2014-02-19/how-much-does-it-cost-to-be-a-web-developer/). I think Jonathon missed an important cost - he forgot what it's like to be starting out. It's a common problem, and one that inevitably plauges even the [great](http://blog.codinghorror.com/paul-grahams-participatory-narcissism/) [ones](http://blog.codinghorror.com/has-joel-spolsky-jumped-the-shark/). I don't mean to belittle what Mr. Hill does for a living. While I don't have a lot of experience with his work, I'm sure he's a great web developer. And I'm sure that his work is incredible because of the tools he has. 

What I take issue with is that he seems to believe that this is what a new developer requires to be great. On the contrary, I think having tools like this at your disposal from the beginning causes one of two things.

1. You start, the tools don't confer god-like web development skills. You get upset and leave.
2. You start, the tools don't confer god-like web development skills. You get upset and work harder. 

One of those two is good - and that same one doesn't require the initial investment that Mr. Hill thinks. 

### The real cost

- Laptop (Hey, you probably have one of these right now!) ~ 700$
- Books ~500$*
- Linux (this one is optional, but if you're new to development I'd recommend it. There are a lot of great tools and utilities out there that show up on linux first. They won't be pretty, but god dammit they'll be awesome.)

*optional

**Total Startup Cost:** ~1200$

The books, of course, are not required but eventually you'll find that there are some things that people will always refer to that you'd like to have around. [Javascript: The Good Parts](http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742) for example. Or the [Dragon Book](http://www.amazon.com/Compilers-Principles-Techniques-Tools-Edition/dp/0321486811). Books are very important. 

The beauty of the web is that it isn't memory intensive when you're trying to figure out what you're doing. But it can grow to whatever you want.

### What about training?
Technology moves fast. Really fast. You know that awesome new phone you got two months ago? *Out  of date*. You know that great new framework you learned last year? *Technology has made that irrelevant*. I will agree with Mr. Hill to a certain degree here. A technology focused college education is quite the waste of time. However, I don't recommend skipping it right away. There are other things that a college education offers you apart from your program. 

Presentations, working with others, taking charge of projects when you end up with a bunch of slackers. Making the tough decisions to kick that one dude out of your group because he does nothing. Essays, reports, being on time. And the most important to a FREELANCE WEB DEVELOPER THAT MR HILL SEEMS TO MISS. **MANAGING YOUR TIME**. For many people College is the first time when they're left to their own devices. They are responsible for themselves and they have to figure out how they work best, and how to manage their social lives AND their work lives. People are give 4 years to make this work. Four years when you're allowed to screw things up and start over. Because the thing is, once those 4 years are up, if you don't have some understanding of how to be you - you're pretty fucked. 

However, don't waste your education on a technological degree. Instead, I'd recommend doing something unrelated. Psycology, Marketing, or even English/Theater. 

See there's a weird stereotype about a lot of tech people - they tend to be rather introverted. This isn't true for everyone of course, but for those whom it is, you have to understand that even when you enter the workforce as a developer, you still need to interact with people. A LOT. 

You have meetings and phone calls, you have to explain your choices to management and clients. If you're a freelancer, you have even MORE work. You need to be a sales guy, support staff and a developer. If you find it hard to talk to people - good luck. 

>It's a great time to be a good
developer. 
~ Jonathon Hill

How true it is Mr. Hill. It is a great time to be a good developer. But starting out with a 3000$ investment doesn't make you a good developer.

Having the drive to be better makes you a good developer. 

------------------
Again, I feel like I have to point out - I think Mr. Hill has some great work. Browsing through his projects, I'm not claiming he doesn't know what he's talking about. Just that maybe he's forgotten what it's like to start out as a developer.
